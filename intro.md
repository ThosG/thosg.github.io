Here are short introductions to a variety of different notations. Some are illustrations of our thesis about notational lifecycles; others, because they are examples of clever design; still others, because they are too important to be left out; and yet more – because we liked them for their own sake. But how to organise them? In the end we decided to do it alphabetically.

Here are some notations and information structures that have appealed to us. Obviously these are but a tiny fraction of the notations that have been devised over the centuries; how did we choose? Some are here because they illustrate particularly well some of the points raised in the main text, such as the logic-circuit diagram (I suppose we need some way to refer to particular cases). Some are here because we were initially surprised such a notation existed (aerobatics). Some illustrate structural problems rather than notational problems – currently, our favourite example is the booklet describing ‘hôtels’ (palaces) of Paris, although as that booklet is in French we may change our mind. Some are are because the idea is so beautiful we can’t ignore it, such as the idea of a nomogram; some illustrate well the advantages to be gained by changing the viewpoint, such as fire-spread diagrams if I can find them; and some are here simply because we are awestruck, as for instance the notation of French courtly baroque dance. We have included some everyday examples, such as the evolving structure of UK vehicle licence numbers, and some quite recherché examples, such as German lute tablature: the former because it so well demonstrates diachronic aspects, the latter because it is so well suited to a small but demanding context, *viz.* dictation by a blind player to an amanuensis.

In other words, we grabbed what appealed to us, for a whole variety of reasons.

Not all of the notations appear in the main text, and conversely there are notations described in the main text that don’t appear here, such as CSS I expect. 

No notation can be properly understood until you have used it in ‘in anger’, as they say, and we have certainly not used all these in anger. Who would trust us to attempt aerobatic manoeuvres simply to see whether we could understand the notation? Necessarily our descriptions are superficial and in many cases our assessments of their usability and learnability are conjectural, open to correction from anyone with real experience.
